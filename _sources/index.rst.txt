    import themata

    project = 'First Doc'

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is at `https://thecarisma.github.io/themata <https://thecarisma.github.io/themata>`_.
To read the documentation offline run the `gendoc.bat` command in the docs/ folder to generate a 
**dist** folder.

How it works
-------------

In each of the theme folder, the `theme.conf` is used to declare the the defult theme options, the 
`layout.html` file is the template for all the generated pages in the theme. The `__init__.py` 
file is where the theme and it version is added to sphinx. `static\*.css_t` is the cascaded style 
sheet template for the theme.

of the theme in *themata* folder then add your static css file ending with .css_t. Write a
